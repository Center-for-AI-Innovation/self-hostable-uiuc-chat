LangGraph Testing Document

This is a test document for verifying the UIUC Chat ingestion and retrieval pipeline.

Key Concepts:
- LangGraph is a powerful framework for building stateful multi-actor applications with large language models
- It enables creating dynamic graphs that represent language relationships effectively
- The framework supports graph algorithms for analysis, such as shortest paths, clustering, and centrality measures
- LangGraph integrates seamlessly with Python-based workflows and can be used for advanced language analysis

Technical Details:
- Built on top of Python and designed for scalability
- Supports various graph visualization tools like NetworkX, Graphviz, PyVis, and Plotly
- Enables building robust and scalable systems for language-based graph analysis
- Provides clean, maintainable, and efficient Python code with proper documentation

Use Cases:
- Language relationship mapping and exploration
- Multi-actor conversational systems
- Complex workflow orchestration with LLMs
- Advanced linguistic pattern analysis and visualization

This document should be successfully ingested, processed, and retrievable through the chat system.
