# 1.42.1, which expects a different chromium revision than the one at the root-owned
# /pw-browsers, so the bundled browser is unusable and the launch fails with
# BrowserLaunchError. Pointing PLAYWRIGHT_BROWSERS_PATH at a myuser-owned dir lets us
# install the chromium that matches our pinned playwright (no EACCES, no --with-deps:
# the base image already carries chromium's system libraries).
