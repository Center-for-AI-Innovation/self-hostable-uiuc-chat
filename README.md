## Quickstart (Self host with Docker)

### üéâ Get started with a single command

```bash
sudo bash init.sh
```
This will: 
* Create a `.env` file. You can customize this later to change the default passwords.
* Initialize all our databases (Redis, Minio, Qdrant, Postgres/Suapabse)
* Start the backend service running on http://localhost:3012 To customize HTTP port used as the main entrypoint, set the `FLASK_PORT` variabel in your `.env`.


To start fresh, you can use: 
```bash
# erase and factory reset all databases
sudo bash init.sh --wipe_data
```

### Configuring Postgres (Supabase)

It's strongly recommende to change your passwords away from the defaults. The Supabase .env file is separate from the rest of the code for seamless compatibility with Supabase's self hosted offering on github, and to maintain compatibility with their guides and general community information.
The .env file is stored in the local path: `./supabase/docker/.env`

### Configuring Database passwords

Customize your env variables. The SQL database can be any of SQLite, Postgres, and Supabase. The object storage can be Minio or AWS S3. 

### Take schema dump from Postgres (Supabase)
```bash
PGPASSWORD=<password> pg_dump -h aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com -U postgres.twzwfuydgnnjcaopyfdv -d postgres --schema-only > schema.sql
```

### Restore dump in new Postgres
```bash
PGPASSWORD=<password> psql -h <new-hostname> -U <new-db> -d postgres -f schema.sql
```

Works on version: `Docker Compose version v2.27.1-desktop.1`

Works on Apple Silicon M1 `aarch64`, and `x86`.

## üì£ Development

## Fastest way to rebuild the images during dev

```bash
# rebuild only the frontend after file changes in that repo. Super quick, supports Docker's Layer Cache.
sudo bash init.sh --rebuild=uiuc-chat-frontend

# rebuild both frontend and backend after file changes
sudo bash init.sh --rebuild="uiuc-chat-frontend flask-app "
```
